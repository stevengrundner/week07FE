//      1) Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.

ages = [3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93];
console.log(ages);

//      a)  Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array.
//          Do not use numbers to reference the last element, find it programmatically.
//          ages[7] - ages[0] is not allowed!

console.log(ages[ages.length -1] - (ages [0]));

//      b)  Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic. (works for arrays of different lengths).

ages = [3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93, 100];

console.log(ages[ages.length -1] - (ages [0]));

//      c)  Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age.










//      2)      Create an array called names that contains the following values: 'Sam', 'Tommy', 'Tim', 'Sally', 'Buck', 'Bob'.

let names = ['Sam', 'Tommy', 'Tim', 'Sally', 'Buck', 'Bob'];

//      2a)     Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average number of letters per name.

//      2b)     Use a loop to iterate through the array again and concatenate all the names together, separated by spaces.

//      3)      How do you access the last element of any array?

//      4)      How do you access the first element of any array?
